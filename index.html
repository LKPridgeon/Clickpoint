          <p>
            We are currently looking into a different hosting sollution for the new year. We have been with Hosting24 for over
            a year and have enjoyed their service but would like to improove the whole site. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting January 2015 we are going to support https on all site pages under clkpts.uk and lkp.me whilst expanding the
            grasp of clickpoint.uk.to. Furthermore we are going to do a product page redesign and fix the collision box issues with
            the site design.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may consider staying with Hosting24 if we can't find a new host by the 20th December but we are expanding to use
            openshift for some areas of the site such as the html5 games. Thank-you and Happy Holidays!
