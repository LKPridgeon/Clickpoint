            Ok a new host has been found and full ssl will be added to clkpts.uk however unfortunately we have had to give up clickpoints.co.uk 
            thats not to say we won't find a new domain to replace it though. clickpoint.uk.to is now being routed through cloudflare and 
            we hope to be back up by the middle of January.

          <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Site down...</h3>
          <p>
            We are currently looking into a different hosting sollution for the new year. We have been with Hosting24 for over
            a year and have enjoyed their service but would like to improove the whole site. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting January 2015 we are going to support https on all site pages under clkpts.uk and lkp.me whilst expanding the
            grasp of clickpoint.uk.to. Furthermore we are going to do a product page redesign and fix the collision box issues with
            the site design.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may consider staying with Hosting24 if we can't find a new host by the 20th December but we are expanding to use
            openshift for some areas of the site such as the html5 games. Thank-you and Happy Holidays!
